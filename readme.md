To start the procucer/consumer pipeline you need to have monica package next your project folder. 

open a console run in this order:

1. start_monica_server.cmd
2. start_consumer.cmd
3. start_producer.cmd

the server will remain open. 
If you need to run this repeatedly execute start_consumer.cmd and start_producer.cmd in separate consoles.
